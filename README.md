What the project is

This is a web page dedicated to my hometown Oxnard, California. It is similar to a pamphlet and it highlights cool things around Oxnard that are worth checking out. It was built using only HTML and CSS.

Why I made it

I made the project to brush up on HTML and CSS skills. I first created the design in Figma and tried to replicate the page to the best of my ability.

What I learned from it

I learned about the power of flexbox and how it is able to organize web pages into blocks of content. I started to thing about how I could block off different parts of a page into its own block. Breaking down the web page into defined sections then breaking those sections into into individual elements is how I started to see things. This skill saves a lot of time when creating the HTML. I would break down the lessons into two parts: 1. Think about how elements are structured (Box out pages and break them down into smaller components) and 2. If there are multiple components next to each other in a single block think about how flexbox could be used here. I am not the fastest when it comes to being able to style, but I am happy with being able to translate the figma design into code good accuracy.
